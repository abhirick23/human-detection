Human detection is the task of locating all instances of human beings present in an image, and it has been most widely accomplished by searching all locations in the image, at all possible scales, and comparing a small area at each location with known templates or patterns of people.
Histogram of Oriented Gradients:- The goal is to check how darker is the current pixel compared to the surrounding pixels. The algorithm draws and arrows showing the direction of the image getting darker. It repeats the process for each and every pixel in the image. At last, every pixel would be replaced by an arrow, these arrows are called Gradients. These gradients show the flow of light from light to dark. By using these gradients algorithms perform further analysis.
